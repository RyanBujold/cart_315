### Thoughts:
- I decided to do a puzzle game with puzzle script engine since I found the game "bloom" very enjoyable to mess around with
- I somehow managed to make the editor stop working
- It turned out to be some syntax bug with words not capitalized 
- I used the game's documentation and took some commands from there to create the basic puzzle idea
- Then I just started messing around with making levels using the mechanics
- Added the mole and had a lot of difficulty setting it up since you couldn't pass through it without killing you
- Decided that the mole moves similarly to the player to make for a more interesting obstacle
- Found that moving into walls was the dominant strategy to solve most puzzles and invalidated the mole's challenge often 
- Added spikes to make this way more challenging
- The mole could delete not only enemies but also the win flag
- So I used this as the gimmick for the final level
- The later levels with the mole onwards are buggy and not well balanced

### Playtest notes: 
- everyone liked the game and found it very challenging
- Someone who likes puzzle games specifically really enjoyed it

## Exploration Prototype 1
- I forgot to work on this. I think that my goals going forward will be to not forget again and mess around to find something interesting to turn the prototype into.
